Project Concept and Motivation of the project
- Developed a cross-platform "Task Manager Mobile Application" that is built with "React Native" by using "Visual Studio Code"
- Incorporates gamification, privacy and is user-friendly for task management
- Implemented with essential task management processes such as  planning, tracking, and prioritizing to provide support and enhance the userâ€™s experience in completing their tasks and events.
- Whereas, gamification functionality would act as motivation and provide the feeling of contentment to the user after completing their assigned tasks or events

Features that I have implemented to the task manager application: 
- Add/Edit task
- Delete task
- Checklist
- Reminder based on the due date
- Sorting the task according to priority and due date
- Calendar Integration
- Edit Profile (username, profile image)
- Gamification that allows users to unlock a new profile image when they complete a certain number of tasks
- A secure page that allows users to store important information on a secured page
- Asyncstorage that stores the data of the application locally 

Implementation Strategy
- Uses "Agile Methodology" to implements the technologies and methods that I have decided on my project's development
- My plan is to undergo the process of designing, survey, implementing and testing
- My key milestones will be designing wireframes, implementation of the project, user survey and user testing
- These phases will be iterative until the project meets the requirements of the user and achieves the aim and objectives of the project
- Uses "Gantt Chart" to plan my project's milestones and subtasks

Evaluation
- User Survey on Task Manager application Feature Priority, Application Design, Application Design Enhancement and High Fidelity of the Application Design
- User Acceptance Testing on Navigation, Usability and Prioritizing Algorithm of each prototype
- User Testing on Logic and UI of the application after each stages of development
- Conducted Competitor Analysis on the similar application on the market
- Conducted a User Survey on the User Preferences for the Task Manager application features
